				"text": "Films cost money. <br>However, they hope to make that money back and often do. When they do, it can be a lot and when they don’t it can be bitter. Sometimes they don’t expect to make money but they unexpectadly do. They often consume ridiculous amounts of effort, people and skill; they scream and shout to get into the public sphere which in turn decides their rise or fall. Films are bets on human taste and they ought to entertain to succeed. It's the fickle relationship between business interests and public taste that can make it joyous or painful to look at films and their money-harvest. Sizeable investments can in fact accrue mountains of gold while sometimes money just evaporates in front of empty screens. This visual story shows the ups and downs (or rather rights and lefts) of the film business, portraying a handful of stories, surprises and failures. Just keep on scrolling...
